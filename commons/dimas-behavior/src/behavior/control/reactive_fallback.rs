/// The `ReactiveFallback` behavior is used to try different strategies until one succeeds,
/// but every strategy is re-evaluated on each tick.
/// All the children are ticked from first to last:
/// - If a child returns RUNNING, continue to the next sibling.
/// - If a child returns FAILURE, continue to the next sibling.
/// - If a child returns SUCCESS, stop and return SUCCESS.
///
/// If all the children fail, than this node returns FAILURE.
///
/// IMPORTANT: to work properly, this node should not have more than
///            a single asynchronous child.
